DESCRIPTION_1 = "This project involved auditing the steam and condensate network installation, including an audit of " \
                "steam traps. The goal was to identify anomalies throughout the entire factory" \
                "installation, from the boiler room to the process and steam tracing, all the way to the condensate " \
                "return to the degassing tank." \
                "After identifying these issues, I presented recommended solutions to improve energy efficiency by " \
                "30%, " \
                "optimize and decarbonize the site, and improve productivity. The project required a deep " \
                "understanding of steam and condensate systems, as well as an ability to analyze and diagnose " \
                "problems in order to create effective solutions."

DESCRIPTION_2 = "This is my personal blog Restful API app that I created using <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, " \
                "and Flask </b>as the backend. " \
                "The app utilizes a SQL database using <b>Flask Sqlalchemy</b>. The blog covers various Flask topics," \
                "including <b>Flask-Admin, Flask-Login, Flask-WTF Forms, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migration, Flask-Mail," \
                "Flask-Upload</b>, and many more. With this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in web development," \
                "particularly in utilizing Flask as a powerful framework for creating robust and scalable web " \
                "applications."

DESCRIPTION_3 = "Study, audit, and expertise of the cardboard of Sahel for the large Poulina group!" \
                "It's a <b> pressurized (5 barg) condensate recovery system with the BAVIERA system </b>. " \
                "By auditing the steam " \
                "traps and regulation I was able to identify the anomalies in the existing installation." \
                "I also solved a problem of <b>condensate return overpressure to the degassing tank</b>, which helped " \
                "<b>improve energy efficiency by 20% and productivity </b>" \
                "(eliminating problems encountered with double-sided preheaters)."

DESCRIPTION_4 = "Study of the milk pasteurization group: there were problems with all the pasteurization units and " \
                "tubular heat exchangers due to condensate blockages (a steam trap was installed at each exchanger " \
                "outlet). The entire condensate return system of the steam traps was replaced with steam trap-pump " \
                "to prevent water hammer problems and condensate blockages. This allowed for a <b> 30% increase in " \
                "productivity (reduced pasteurization time) and a 15% increase in energy efficiency</b>."

DESCRIPTION_5 = "The purpose of this project was to create a fully functional website for RMI from scratch, " \
                "utilizing <b>HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, JQuery, and Flask</b> in the backend. With the introduction of " \
                "a " \
                "contact form and a section for products and services, customers are now able to easily request " \
                "quotes and receive information about RMI's offerings." \
                "The ultimate goal of this project was to enhance RMI's online presence and provide a <b>user-friendly " \
                "interface for customers to interact with the company</b>. By implementing features such as <b>Flask " \
                "Mail, " \
                "JQuery Ajax, and Flask Recaptcha</b>, we were able to create a seamless experience for both the " \
                "customers and the RMI team." \
                "Overall, this project has not only improved RMI's online visibility but has also made it easier for " \
                "the company to connect with its customers and potential clients. The website now serves as a " \
                "<b>valuable tool for RMI's business development and growth</b>."

DESCRIPTION_6 = "The purpose of the audit of the steam and condensate installation for the animal feed industry was " \
                "to identify and address the anomalies caused by steam traps in the installation. The steam traps " \
                "were causing a significant energy loss, which was resulting in a decrease in productivity due to the " \
                "increase in pressure in the condensate return system. The aim of the project was to optimize the " \
                "circuit by implementing separate high and low-pressure return circuits to recover all the " \
                "condensate. This optimization would result in a significant improvement in energy efficiency and " \
                "increase in productivity. By identifying and addressing these issues, the animal feed industry could " \
                "operate more efficiently and sustainably, saving both energy and resources while improving their " \
                "overall output. The audit demonstrated the importance of regular monitoring and maintenance of " \
                "industrial installations to ensure their efficient operation and minimize their environmental impact."

DESCRIPTION_7 = "In this project, the goal was to gather information about all the steam traps models and their " \
                "specifications with datasheets, as well as their applications in different industries such as " \
                "pharmaceutical, agro-food, and petrochemical. To achieve this, we used web scraping techniques with " \
                "<b>Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas libraries </b> to extract the necessary data from TLV " \
                "website tables " \
                "and transform them into data frames. The final output was a comprehensive Excel database that " \
                "included all the required information, which was used to support our company RMI's business " \
                "operations."

DESCRIPTION_8 = "The Habit Tracker web application is a personal project developed using <b>Flask and MongoDB " \
                "database</b>. " \
                "The purpose of this application is to track daily tasks and routines and improve personal " \
                "productivity. With this app, users can easily create, manage, and track their daily habits and " \
                "goals. The application is built with Flask and uses Flask-PyMongo to connect to the MongoDB " \
                "database. Users can create an account and log in to the app to start tracking their habits. The app " \
                "provides a simple and intuitive interface to add, edit, and delete habits. Users can also view their " \
                "progress over time through the app's analytics dashboard. The main advantage of using MongoDB is its " \
                "flexibility to handle unstructured data, making it ideal for tracking habits and routines that may " \
                "vary from day to day. This project has allowed me to improve my skills on <b>NoSQL</b> databases and " \
                "backend web development using <b>Flask and MongoDB</b>."

DESCRIPTION_9 = "For our client operating in the production of margarine and vegetable oils, we conducted an audit to " \
                "address the issue of elevated pressure levels in their margarine pasteurization process. After " \
                "careful analysis, we identified the problem to be caused by the mechanical pressure regulator. To " \
                "resolve this, we replaced the mechanical regulator with a control valve and a pressure transmitter " \
                "to regulate the pressure according to the temperature set by the pasteurization machine's automation " \
                "system. This solution effectively addressed the pressure issue, improving the efficiency and " \
                "productivity of the client's production process."
